# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @huffer007 and @huffer007@hotmail.com will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @huffer007 @huffer007@hotmail.com

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @huffer007 and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.txt    @huffer007

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.r huffer007@hotmail.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
# *.txt @octo-org/octocats

# In this example, @huffer007 owns any files in the code
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/code/ @huffer007

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  huffer007@hotmail.com

# In this example, @huffer007 owns any file in an docs directory
# anywhere in your repository.
docs/ @huffer007

# In this example, @huffer007 owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @huffer007

# In this example, @huffer007 owns any file in the `/apps` 
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github` 
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
